                This website started out as a personal project while I was studying MVC .NET as a way to solidify my skills with using the franework.
                It uses various features of the framework to simplify presenting and adding new content such as Models, Routing, Identities, Data Validation and others.

            <span>
                Instead of being static, the art gallery is designed to automatically fetch all images uploaded to it and present them with automatically generated thumbnails that
                adapt to each image based on it being either portrait or landscape oriented. On click, images are then displayed in a modal window along with their respective titles and descriptions.

            <span>
                Using MVC .NET in order to build a simple image gallery might seem like an overkill but the Models and User Identity features of MVC allowed me to implement an admin panel in order
                to let me easily add new pieces to my digital art gallery from any device, without having to manually make changes to the source code every time.
